# twilio-helper [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/chrisgeo/twilio-helper.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chrisgeo/twilio-helper)

CAVEATS:

* Tests are incomplete, the twilio account ran out of funds
* Probably should make a few of those methods return promises instead of embedding multiple async calls. Though embedded promises seems like a poor choice to me as well.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save twilio-helper
```

## Run the tests

```bash
gulp test
```
